SENTINEL PRIME v2.0
Institutional Multi-Asset Governance: Cloud-Native AI Sentiment & Quantitative Telemetry
Live Dashboard:

Sentinel Prime is a distributed risk governance infrastructure designed for high-frequency volatility environments. It synchronizes local Edge Computing (ASUS TUF) with a Global Cloud Vault (Supabase) to enforce capital preservation through real-time cross-asset analysis (XAU, BTC, MCX) and narrative intelligence.

🏛️ Governance Philosophy
Sentinel Prime mitigates "Single Point of Failure" risk via a Hybrid Distributed System:

Edge-to-Cloud Sync: Real-time price telemetry and AI-driven narrative scores are fused in a centralized SQL node.

Multi-Asset Correlation: Simultaneously monitors Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin to detect systemic liquidity shifts.

Governance-as-Code: Implements a remote Kill Switch protocol for immediate engine termination via cloud command.

🧠 System Architecture
1. Multi-Asset Pulse Engine (Edge)
The engine runs locally to leverage hardware threading for simultaneous fetching:

Asset Matrix: Real-time monitoring of XAU/USD, XAG/USD, BTC/USD, and MCX (Gold/Silver).

Regime Classification: Statistical Z-Score modeling classifies assets as STABLE, STRESS, or ANOMALY.

2. AI Narrative Sentinel (NLP)
A dedicated Transformer-based process for zero-latency sentiment extraction:

FinBERT Integration: Processes institutional news feeds to generate a Geopolitical Stress Score.

Narrative Fusion: AI scores are combined with price dispersion for a 360-degree risk view.

3. Cloud Command Center (Streamlit)
A global UI that serves as the "Executive Face" of the system:

Real-time Heartbeat: Monitoring connection health between the Edge Node and the Cloud.
